<!-- 

- Create a form in HTML with inputs for relevant data
- When the form is submitted, access the data from the form in the form's submit `event` object
- Create a list in HTML
- Append the submitted data to the list
- Add a "Delete All" `<button>` which clears all of the list items from the list

Note: If you are at all unclear about the process of reading and writing to the DOM, complete the MVP, writing all the code in one function. Understanding the `document`'s methods is the main learning for this homework. Abstracting code into helper functions is secondary.
